# Viewer

The viewer should be a simple program that allows model files to be displayed, imported, and exported. 
It forms the basis for all other programs, as it contains the basic functionality of all the others and is a good way to easily make use of the renderer.
At a later stage, the repository will be forked and used to develop the builder.

## Requirements
